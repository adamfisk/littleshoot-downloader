The LittleShoot P2P Downloader uses the LittleShoot P2P Core to download files from multiple 
sources in parallel. The downloading algorithm itself is easily configurable, and all downloads
use HTTP range requests for compatibility with existing web servers. Download sources can be
peers or standard servers, and HTTP traffic flows over TCP or more commonly reliable UDP 
connections in the case of NAT-traversed P2P sessions. The downloader itself is not concerned
with these details, however, as they are all handled at a lower level in the LittleShoot
P2P Core.
